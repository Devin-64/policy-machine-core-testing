## Introduction

The purpose of Policy Machine Core project is to provide a bare bones library for NGAC.  This library includes interfaces
to interact with NGAC components,simple implementations of those interfaces, and algorithms to query the state of a graph.
This is a great place to start experimenting with NGAC and different policy configurations.
